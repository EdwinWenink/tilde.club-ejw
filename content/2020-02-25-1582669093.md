# Opening posts in Vim 

@1582669093

## Based on filename

Use the naming convention of 2020-02-25-1582669093 (date-timestamp)

- Seach on date:
    *  `vim 2020-02-25`
- In case of multiple entries on the same date, use (sections of) the unique timestamp
    * `vim *093.md`
    * `vim *909*`

## Based on content

grep grep grep

- e.g. `grep TIMESTAMP content/*` 

## Searching title with grep

- `grep -il "Opening posts in Vim" | xargs vim`

-i flag makes the search case insensitive (optional)

-l is important because it only returns the filename of the match, so you can pass it as an argument to the `vim` command with `xargs`.

## Open most recently edited file

This assumes you are in the content directory (i.e. the same directory as the most recently edited file):

`!v`

Alternatively, you can find the most recently edited file with:

```
vim `ls -t | head -1`
```

Be aware of the backticks!
`ls -t` sorts on edit time, with the most recently edited file on top. 

## Open latest post

Because all posts are chronologically ordered due to the used naming convention, we can also list all content files and open only the last one:

```
vim `ls | tail -1`
```
