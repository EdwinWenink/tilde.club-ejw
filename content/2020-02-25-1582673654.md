1. `w` command

Run `w` to see all logged in users, as well as their current process.
To see info of a specific user, type `w ejw`:

```
 16:35:48 up 71 days, 19:54, 24 users,  load average: 2.36, 1.81, 1.83
USER     TTY        LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT
ejw      pts/94    13:26    4.00s  0.46s  0.00s tmux
```

2. `who` command
3. `users`

Returns a space separated list.
This is all on one line, so grep is useless here.

4. `finger`

This command is actually for finding out user information and contact details, but also kind of works for this purpose.
It looks like it does not matter that some people may not have changed their user information.
