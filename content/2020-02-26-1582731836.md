# User information with finger

@1582731836

The phrasing of this command lends itself quite well for stupid jokes.

## Finding information on others

For an overview of all online users: `finger`

For a specific user: `finger [username]`

## Setting your own information, plan and project

Use the `chfn` (change finger) command for this.

The -o and -p flags are used for your office and office phone, but according to ~pfhawkins we use the following convention on this tilde:

```
chfn -f "Full name" username
chfn -o "Your city here" username
chfn -p "Your country or state here" username
```

Additionally, you can notify others what you are up to by making a plan at `~/.plan`.

You can also indicate others of a project you are working on by making `~/.project`. 

All this information will be included when people "finger" you.
